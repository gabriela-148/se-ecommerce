To run the project on Xcode, you will need CocoaPods installed.

Follow this YouTube video but just the "Set Up CocoaPods" part only! (And the Problems with Cocoapods if your Mac has an M1 processor chip)

When opening the project, open Xcode. Go to File, then Open. Find where the project is and ONLY open the store app.xcworkspace file in Xcode. This is the only file that has the Pods attached.

Firebase database is already set up. I added you all as admins on the database using your SJU emails. 

Once at firebase.google.com, click "Go To Console" at top right and use your sju to log in. The StoreApp should already be there when you log in.
